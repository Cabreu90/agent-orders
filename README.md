Background 
==========
Orders can be submitted to Nature via an agent. These agents act as an intermediary between groups of companies and 
Nature. This technical test is a simplification of this process where the imported orders are held in XML files. The 
application is to be used by a business user to see an overview to what orders are being imported. 

Test 
====
The aim of the test is to work out how to fix an error caused by loading a specific XML file. There are two XML files included 
with this test that can be processed by the application. Orders2012-03-01.xml is a *valid* file and will be processed correctly. 
Orders2012-04-01.xml is *invalid* and will not be processed correctly. You should aim to fix the web application so that errors are not 
thrown when processing Orders2012-04-01.xml. 

Remember that we are interested in learning about how you approach this problem, not just the final result.
